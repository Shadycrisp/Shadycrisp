- 👋 Hi, I’m @Shadycrisp
- 👀 I’m interested in programming video games! And I am also looking into app development soon!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about arduino and C++, as I am working on a mini sattelite, participating in the competition Cansat in Greece!
- 💞️ I’m not currently looking to colaborate on anything, but I would love to be a part of some projects in the near future!
